# A Deep Learning Approach to Predicting Household Water Usage in Karachi
Water shortage is an increasingly critical problem
for countries worldwide, and water usage prediction is crucial
for effective long-term planning. This research presents a deeplearning
approach to predict water usage for a household based
on smart-meter data and weather conditions. We have used
LSTMs for prediction based on existing literature for accurate
long-time forecasting. The dataset used is the water usage data
for a single household in Karachi that has been collected by
the Karachi Water Project using smart meters. The goal of this
project is to train a deep learning model to predict future water
usage for the household, which can then be generalised for a
larger number of households, and potentially predict water usage
for the city of Karachi on a larger scale - and aid future water
planning and distribution.
